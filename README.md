# ClassCatalogue

This is my solution to the classroom task. It contains 3 classes, GradeCatalogue, Student and Gradebook. I had problems getting the file to be read correctly, using the read file as inputs into my classes and how I should go about using classes as inputs in other classes. I figured out which class should do what after some consideration but that was a problem early on.
