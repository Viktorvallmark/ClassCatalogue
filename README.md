# ClassCatalogue

This is my solution to the classroom task. It contains 3 classes, GradeCatalogue, Student and Gradebook. I had problems getting the file to be read correctly, using the read file as inputs into my classes and how I should go about using classes as inputs in other classes. I figured out which class should do what after some consideration but that was a problem early on.


This product should read a text file, parse the data into proper types, with which one can use to get information about different students grades. After running the program the user can find information about students they've selected and statistics about their grades, including their highest, lowest and average grade.
